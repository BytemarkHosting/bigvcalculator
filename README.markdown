# BigV Pricing Calculator

An angularjs dynamic pricing calculator for bytemark's bigvio cloud
hosting service.

## Building
This project relies on the http://yeoman.io build tool from google
for building the distribution version. However I have included the /dist directory in the repository if you just want to deploy it/host it as it is.

To build just run:

    yeoman build


To run a development version that has livereload:
    
    yeoman server
